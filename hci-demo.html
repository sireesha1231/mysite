    <h4>Conceptualization</h4>
    <h4>Can we have a mobile app that can save us in a dangerous situation?</h4>
    <p>Bachao (Hindi for “save me”) is a mobile-based application that the user can use in case of distress.</p>
    <p>We have categorized danger into four levels and designed solutions for the same.</p>
    <img id="prototype" src="danger_levels.PNG">
    <p><strong>No Danger</strong></p>
    <p>The user faces no dangerous situation at all.</p>
    <p><strong>Low Danger</strong></p>
        <p>The user enters a danger zone, he receives a notification about past crimes that have occured in that area. He can chose to be tracked for the next couple of hours or opt for an alternate route.</p>
    <p><strong>Medium Danger</strong></p>
        <p>The user feels unsafe and has the ability to open the app and call 911 or alert his emergency contacts or ring a loud siren to ensure his safety.</p>
    <p><strong>High Danger</strong></p>
        <p>The user is in a very dangerous situation. He does not have the time to open the app and click on "Help". He triggers the call to 911 by clicking on the home screen widget which is easily accessible.</p>
  </div>
</div> 

<div class="requirements" id="requirements">
  <div class="container">
    <h4>Core User Requirements</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>The user may sign in to the app using login credentials.</li>
      <li>The user may view a short tutorial on what the app does.</li>
      <li>The user may view notifications from the app and also choose to stop notifications if he wishes to from Android app settings.</li>
      <li>The user may choose how many hours he wishes to be tracked for.</li>
      <li>The user may send situation specific messages to his emergency contacts.</li>
      <li>The user may alert 911 through the app.</li>
      <li>The user may ring a loud siren to alarm his attacker through the app.</li>
      <li>The user may alert 911 through a home screen widget in case of a high danger situation.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Selection of Design Sketches</h4>
    <p>After performing three-level iterations on design sketches, we have narrowed down to seven main design challenges.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Quick and efficient app trigger</li>
      <p>The app can be triggered using a home screen widget that has a button to alert 911.</p>
      <li>Different levels of Emergency</li>

    <h4>Formative Evaluation</h4>
    <p>Performed Cognitive Walkthrough via paper prototyping.</p>
    <img src="formative_evaluation.png" style="height:300px; width:400px;">
    <p><strong>Task 1 - Low Level Emergency</strong></p>
      <p>Users have Bachao installed and are entering a danger zone. They receive a
notification about recent incidents that have occurred in the area. They choose to be tracked.</p>
<p>Overall Findings - We had decided to make the “Track Me” and “Alternate Route” Buttons more prominent so
that it immediately catches the user’s eye.</p>
<img id="prototype" src="low_level.PNG">
<img id="prototype" src="low_level1.PNG">


      <p><strong>Task 2 - Low Level Emergency</strong></p>
      <p>Users have Bachao installed and are entering a danger zone. They receive a
notification about recent incidents that have occurred in the area. They opt for an alternate (safer)
route.</p>
<p>Overall Findings - We won’t be highlighting the existing route.</p>
<img id="prototype" src="low_level.PNG">
<img id="prototype" src="low_level3.PNG">
<img id="prototype" src="low_level4.PNG">
<img id="prototype" src="low_level5.PNG">


      <p><strong>Task 3 - Medium Level Emergency</strong></p>
      <p>User feels unsafe. She is walking home after work at night. She feels that she is being
followed.</p>
<p>Overall Findings - Messages based on particular emergency situations will be added. Add tutorial of app in Settings tab.</p>

<img id="prototype"src="medium_level3.PNG">
<img id="prototype"src="medium_level4.PNG">
<img id="prototype"src="medium_level5.PNG">


      <p><strong>Task 4 - Medium Level Emergency</strong></p>
      <p>User feels unsafe while walking home after work at night. She sees a group of people following her and wants to alert 911.</p>
      <p>Overall Findings - Reduce unnecessary options. Have more situation-specific message buttons.</p>

<img id="prototype"src="medium_level3.PNG">
<img id="prototype"src="medium_level4.PNG">
<img id="prototype"src="medium_level6.PNG">


      <p><strong>Task 5 - High Level Emergency</strong></p>
      <p>User was walking home, when he is suddenly pulled into a moving van. User gets an
opportunity to click on the widget button to call 911, while perpetrator is trying to silence the
victim.</p>
<p>Task 5 was highly liked by our users.</p>

    <h4>Summative Evaluation</h4>
    <p>Performed Summative Evaluation (Questionnaire) with two users. One has been in a crime situation before and one has not.</p>

        <td>Question - Is the initiative delivering on outputs and outcomes as planned?(efficiency and effectiveness)</td>

Efficiency: Efficiency in a way the app is automatic trigger in case of emergency. Finds widget incredibly helpful.
Effectiveness: Tracks location and alerts authorities with accurate location which is helpful.
</td>

       <tr>
        <td>Question - Are the (or were the) activities and their delivery methods effective? Are there aspects that could have been done differently?(process effectiveness)</td>

Features that can be improved: Interface can be wider and improved.

        <td>Yes, given the crime alert that we receive 2-3 times a month, this app will have an incredible social impact. This app has the potential to save lives. </td>

        <tr>
        <td>Question - How has the initiative influenced the appropriate stakeholder community, and what capacities has it built? (relevance and impact)</td>
        <td>The influence being better security, personalized security, reduced crime-rate. </td>

        <tr>
        <td>Question - Is the project impacting positively on key groups and issues that have been identified as important in project design – particularly gender, indigenous, youth and environment? (relevance and impact)</td>

      </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Question - Is there evidence that the initiative is likely to grow – scaling up and out – beyond the project life? (sustainability)</td>
        <td>Yes, growing the app outside of UIC and pulling data from other databases to increase accuracy would be great. 
Instead of displaying old/fake news, displaying a live update would be better.

    <h4>Future Scope</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Use Chicago's ClearPath API to send tips. Currently ClearPath's API is needs an API key to enable using send tips (API keys are not available right now). Once the API keys are available, we would like to integrate this feature into our app, so that a witness or passerby can report a crime. </li>

<li>Expand outside UIC</li>

<li>Expand to other platforms</li> 

<li>Expand and integrate more features into the application. </li>
