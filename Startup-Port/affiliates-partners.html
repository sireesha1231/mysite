                <p><span style = "font-weight: 700;">The Lonely Entrepreneur Community</span></p>
                <p>The Lonely Entrepreneur is a single destination to help entrepreneurs unlock their potential by turning their passion and pressure into success. It is based on the harrowing story of Michael Dermer, a former New York corporate lawyer that left the law to build the first company to reward people for being healthy. After building his company from scratch for a decade, he watched it almost get destroyed overnight by the financial crisis of 2008. Michael not only saved his business but sold it and became known as an industry pioneer in healthcare. His experiences led him to write the book The Lonely Entrepreneur and to his mission to help entrepreneurs thrive in the struggle. To learn more visit, www.lonelyentrepreneur.com</p>
