                    <p>We love working with like-minded and passionate entrepreneurs who have great idea, product and design instincts—those who want to create something of value, help solve a problem (which others tend not to see…) but know that in order to do so, they need not only backing but a good network of collaborators to help their idea take off and create revenue!</p>

                    <p>We are technology agnostic in our selection process; we want to help all entrepreneurs with ideas, products and business opportunities which have a great value proposition; let it be an app or a brick and mortar traditional business model! We are looking for early stage opportunity ideas that address logical and capital-efficient markets with easy to understand & deploy business models, ideas with strong initial traction and clear market fit.</p>
